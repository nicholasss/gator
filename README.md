# Gator

Gator is an RSS feed aggregator. It allows for different users to follow specific feeds. There is a command to start aggregating the posts in the feed for browsing.

Gator was a guided project with directions and instructions from Boot.dev.

### Installation
Required:
- Go 1.23.1 (or above)

Use the following command to install Gator (as written by me):
